            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am an individual on the Autism Spectrum with the diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome. This diagnosis is rather profound for me because it more or less shows that I have difficulty adjusting to life. An example of adjusting is having a harder time socializing than others. I enjoy games and topics of varying nature which I contribute to a variety of reasons as for why. To learn about more things in particular please view the other pages. PS: May have an obsession with the character Kirby. as you can see with this edited image of them combining them with a character from an indie game called "OMORI" below.</p>
