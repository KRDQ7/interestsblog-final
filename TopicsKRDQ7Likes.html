            <h1>Topics that interest me</h1>
            <h2>Psychology</h2>
            <p>I am interested in various forms and types of psychology. I really want to try understanding why some of the mind works the way it does and this seems like one way to figure out how. A few types in particular that interest me are just generalized (which I would describe as being anything that covers basic parts of psychology) and/or Jungian psychology.</p>
            <h3>More on generalized</h3>
            <p>This means things like the psychology of medicine and diagnoses. I suppose this interests me since I have multiple diagnoses besides just the Autism diagnosis with Asperger's Syndrome. I want to try understanding why the brain works the way it does with these diagnoses and/or if there is any reasons I can wrap my head around about them. Unfortunately I more or less just try to comprehend personality or play psychiatrist and think about whether real or fictional beings have various conditions.</p>
            <h3>More on Jungian</h3>
            <p>I find this intersting probably because of a weird game that uses some terms from it but also because it seems interesting to me. In Jungian psychology there is various terms that classify parts of the mind and what not. I do not fully comprehened it but from what I understand there are various aspects to a person including the Self, the Persona, and the Shadow. Self is the one I do not fully comprehend the meaning behind, which I suppose is because I do not fully comprehend Jungian psychology. I personally interpret it as a union of the Persona and Shadow though. The Persona is often likened to a personality that one puts on in public to brave it. Say for instance a persona of a fool that someone puts on but of one whom truthfully is miserable when by themselves. Lastly there is the Shadow which to Jung is the general evil and ill will mankind harbors or so I have heard. I personally think of the shadow as parts of people that exist that we are ashamed to admit to having. Truth be told I do not understand the concept of the Shadow too much and will not elaborate much on it as I do not fully comprehend it other than how it can be likened to things like the ID from Freudian psychology.</p>
            <h2>Editing</h2>
            <p>As of late I have been trying to edit things such as videos and/or images for entertainment. I usually due various silly things like memes and whatnot.</p>
            <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>Some images I edit are mostly existing ones and I edit them with programs like an online one called Pixlr which is essentially like photoshop by Adobe but online. An example I made of one is an image of Kirby (The Nintendo character) but combined with a character named Wayne from an indie game I played called Hylics. (SEE SAID IMAGE BELOW)</p>
            <img src="warby.png" alt="kirby with a weird expression">
            <h3>Videos</h3>
            <p>Still mostly silly things. At times I may be more serious and record little demos of things, but it is mostly just dumb joke edits.For instance, editing in dumb sounds and whatnot here and there and trying to get graphics on screen in a way that they cover things as a joke form of "animation" or something like that.</p>
